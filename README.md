# Census_Data_Exploration
 Census data cleaning and analysis for a moderately-sized town, concluding with recommendations for local government concerning land development and future service investment.

 Data cleaning was performed to ensure technical correction of the data, handling missing values and data errors.

 Recommendations are based on the analysis of the cleaned data set, to include the demographics of the town, and predictions of population growth, affluency, employment and occupancy.
